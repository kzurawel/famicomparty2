# Famicom Party

<p class="subtitle">Being the personal website of Kevin Zurawel</p>

## Hi!

My name's Kevin, and I am writing a book about programming the NES/Famicom in Assembly. (Looking for the book? It's here: [Famicom Party: Making NES Games in Assembly](/book)). I'm a front-end developer and engineering manager by day and dabbler in retro-computing by night.

Some things I am interested in that I will get around to writing about, eventually, on [the blog](/blog):

- Interactive fiction - theory, best practice, and development in Inform and TADS
- Roguelikes and procedural content generation
- The WebAudio API, synthesizers, and digital audio of all kinds
- "Retrogaming" and the history of game development
- Desktop / GUI application development, especially cross-platform
